## About the Developer

I am a current software quality engineer and I am learning to code. Through this journey, I have multiple projects that I'm using to learn new technologies and improve my skills. LogLog is one of those projects.

Please note that as of this writing, I am not a profession software engineer and LogLog may go through many changes or may go nowhere.
